            Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first internal combustion engine in a car, 
            seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – 
            and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of 
            a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by 
            Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG).
            Emil Jellinek, a European automobile entrepreneur who worked with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG), 
            registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. 
            Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among 
            the highest circles of society in his adopted home. At the time, it was a meeting place for the "Haute Volée"
             of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other well-known people. 
             But Jellinek's plans went further, and in as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, 
             including United States billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, 
             Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès" as a way of concealing his less fancy real name.
              Many consider that race the time of birth for Mercedes-Benz as a brand. Later, in 1901, the name "Mercedes" 
              was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark.[12] The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles were
              produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz 
              company on 28 June of the same year.[11][13]</p>

                <p> Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, 
               he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities 
               in France as well as England, he later started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. 
               At the end of 1863 he was appointed workshop inspector at a machine tool factory in Reutlingen, 
               where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.[14]
                Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was notably popular throughout 
                Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven in a model of this car during his time in power, 
                with modified custom bulletproof windshields.[15] Most of the currently surviving 770 models were sold at 
                auctions to private buyers. One of the cars is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. 
                The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.[16]
                From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products such as the LG3000 lorry and 
                the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To build the latter, in 1936 it built a factory hidden in the forest
                 at Genshagen around 10 kilometres south of Berlin. By 1942 the company had mostly stopped producing cars, 
                 and was now devoted to war production. According to its statement, in 1944 almost half of its 63,610 employees 
                 were forced labourers, prisoners of war or concentration camp detainees.[17] 
                Another source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in reparations</p>

                How it all Began 1909: The three-pointed star on all routes.
                From September 1902 DMG holds the patent for successful “Mercedes” brand name. All that is missing is a characteristic 
                trademark. That’s when the sons of Gottlieb Daimler, Paul and Adolf, remember, that their father previously used a 
                star for a symbol. The DMG Board of Management follows this inspiration and in June 1909 registers both a three-pointed 
                and four-pointed star as trademarks. Both logos are legally protected but it is the three-pointed star that is ultimately 
                used and a three-dimensional star adorns the front radiator of vehicles from 1910 onwards. With the merging of both companies 
                in June 1926, a new brand name is created, which combines the essential elements of the previous emblems.

                Rationalisation of the model nomenclature was announced in November 2014 for future models. The changes consolidate many
                 confusing nomenclature and their placements in the model range such as CL-Class is now called the S-Class Coupé. 
                 The naming structure is divided into four categories: core, off-road vehicle/SUV, 4-door coupé, and roadster. 
                 AMG GT and V-Class are unaffected by the change. In October 2016, Mercedes unveiled the X-Class; a pickup truck built 
                 on the Nissan Navara.[67][68] At the 2016 Paris Motor Show, the company announced the EQ, a family of upcoming battery 
                 electric vehicles based on a modular platform, expected to represent up to 25% of its global sales by 2025.
                 Mercedes-Benz has developed multi-concept cars with alternative propulsion, such as hybrid-electric, fully electric, 
                 and fuel-cell powertrains. At the 2007 Frankfurt motor show, Mercedes-Benz showed seven hybrid models, including the 
                 F700 concept car, powered by a hybrid-electric drivetrain featuring the DiesOtto engine.[72] In 2009, Mercedes-Benz 
                 displayed three BlueZERO concepts at the North American International Auto Show. Each car features a different 
                 powertrain - battery-electric, fuel-cell electric, and gasoline-electric hybrid.[73][74] In the same year, Mercedes 
                 also showed the Vision S500 PHEV concept with a 19 miles (31 km) all-electric range and CO2 emissions of 74 grams/km 
                 in the New European Driving Cycle.

                Since 2002, Mercedes-Benz has developed the F-Cell fuel cell vehicle. The current version, based on the B-Class, has a 
                250-mile range and is available for lease, with volume production scheduled to begin in 2014. Mercedes has also 
                announced the SLS AMG E-Cell, a fully electric version of the SLS sports car, with deliveries expected in 2013.
                The Mercedes-Benz S400 BlueHYBRID[77] was launched in 2009, and is the first production automotive hybrid in the world 
                to use a lithium-ion battery.[78][79][80] In mid-2010, production commenced on the Vito E-Cell all-electric van.
                In 2008, Mercedes-Benz announced that it would have a demonstration fleet of small electric cars in two to three years.
                Mercedes-Benz and Smart are preparing for the widespread uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in the UK by beginning the 
                installation of recharging points across their dealer networks. So far 20 Elektrobay recharging units, produced in the UK 
                by Brighton-based Elektromotive, have been installed at seven locations as part of a pilot project, and further expansion 
                of the initiative is planned later in 2010.</p>

In the United States, Mercedes-Benz was assessed a record US$30.66 million fine for their decision to not meet the federal corporate 
average fuel economy standard in 2009. Certain Mercedes-Benz cars, including the S550 and all AMG models sold in the United States,
 also face an additional gas guzzler tax.However, newer AMG models fitted with the M157 engine will not be subject to the gas-guzzle
 r tax, due to improved fuel economy, and newer models powered by the M276 and M278 engines will have better fuel economy. 
 In 2008, Mercedes also had the worst CO2 average of all major European manufacturers, ranking 14th out of 14 manufacturers.
 Mercedes was also the worst manufacturer in 2007 and 2006 in terms of average CO2 levels, with 181 g and 188 g of CO2 emitted per km, 
 respectively.Mercedes-Benz paid an additional US$38 million for failing to meet its CAFE standards for model years 2008–2011.
In May 2017, Mercedes partnered with Vivint Solar to develop a solar-energy home storage battery.In February 2018, it was announced 
that Mercedes cabin air filters earned the Asthma and Allergy Friendly Certification.
